# annunciator-panel
Custom annunciator panel for grafana, based on the built-in SingleStat panel

Like Singlestat, the Annunciator Panel allows you to show the one main summary stat of a SINGLE series. It reduces the series into a single number (by looking at the max, min, average, or sum of values in the series). Annunciator also displays upper and lower alarm thresholds, colored to according to the value of the stat relative to the threshold, and optional flashing etc.
